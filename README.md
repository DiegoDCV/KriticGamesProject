## Synopsis

There was a puppeteer who sold wood maded puppets to the children of a kingdom. One day, a blacksmith came to the kingdom and asked the puppeteer to work together in iron maded puppets, but the puppeteer rejected his offer. Then, the blacksmith decided to make the iron maded puppets by himself. The children were pleased with the new toys, and they forgot of the wood maded puppets. The puppeteer was so angry, and decided to get revenge. He created thousands of evil puppets with dark powers who could rust the iron. The puppeteer proclaimed himself the king of the Kingdom of the Puppets. 
Now, you're the blacksmith, and you have to defend the kingdom from the Puppeteer and his evil puppets.
